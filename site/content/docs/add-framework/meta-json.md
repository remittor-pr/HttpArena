Create a `meta.json` file in your framework directory:

```json
{
  "display_name": "your-framework",
  "language": "Go",
  "engine": "net/http",
  "type": "framework",
  "description": "Short description of the framework and its key features.",
  "repo": "https://github.com/org/repo",
  "enabled": true,
  "tests": ["baseline", "pipelined", "limited-conn", "json", "upload", "compression", "noisy", "api-4", "api-16", "baseline-h2", "static-h2"],
  "maintainers": ["your-github-username"]
}
```

Only include profiles your framework supports. Frameworks missing a profile simply don't appear in that profile's leaderboard.

### async-db

The `async-db` profile requires an async PostgreSQL driver. The benchmark script starts a Postgres sidecar with 100K rows and passes `DATABASE_URL=postgres://bench:bench@localhost:5432/benchmark` to your container. Your framework must:

1. Connect to Postgres using the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
2. Implement `GET /async-db?min=X&max=Y` that queries: `SELECT id, name, category, price, quantity, active, tags, rating_score, rating_count FROM items WHERE price BETWEEN $1 AND $2 LIMIT 50`
3. Return JSON: `{"items": [...], "count": N}` with nested `rating: {score, count}` and `tags` as a JSON array
4. Return `{"items":[],"count":0}` if the database is unavailable
5. Use lazy connection initialization — retry connecting if Postgres isn't ready at startup

### gateway-64

The `gateway-64` profile tests your framework as part of a complete deployment stack over HTTP/2 with TLS. Unlike other tests that run a single container, this test uses **Docker Compose** to orchestrate multi-container deployments — typically a reverse proxy in front of an application server, but any architecture is allowed.

**Quick start:**

1. Create a `compose.gateway.yml` in your framework directory
2. Define your services (proxy, server, cache — whatever you need)
3. Pin each service to specific CPUs using `cpuset` — total must be exactly 64 logical CPUs (0-31 + 64-95), always in physical+SMT pairs (core N and N+64 together)
4. All services must use `network_mode: host`, `security_opt: [seccomp:unconfined]`, and appropriate ulimits
5. Use `${CERTS_DIR}`, `${DATA_DIR}`, and `${DATABASE_URL}` env vars — they are exported by the benchmark script
6. Port **8443** must serve HTTPS/H2 — this is where the load generator sends requests
7. The stack must implement `/static/*`, `/json`, `/async-db`, and `/baseline2` endpoints

**What makes this different from other tests:**
- You control the full architecture via Docker Compose
- Multiple containers compete for a shared 64-CPU budget
- The proxy, caching layer, and internal protocol choices are all part of the benchmark
- Static files can be served directly by the proxy (e.g., Nginx) instead of the application server

See the [Gateway-64 implementation guide](/docs/test-profiles/h2-gateway/gateway-64/implementation) for detailed documentation, three complete compose examples (two-tier, three-tier, and single-tier), CPU topology rules, and proxy configuration options.
