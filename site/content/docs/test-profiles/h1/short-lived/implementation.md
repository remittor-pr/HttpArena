Same workload as baseline, but each connection is closed and re-established after 10 requests. This forces frequent TCP handshakes.

**Connections:** 512, 4,096

## Expected request/response

Same as baseline - sum of query parameters:

```
GET /baseline11?a=13&b=42 HTTP/1.1
```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain

55
```

## What it measures

- Socket creation and teardown overhead
- Connection accept rate
- Per-connection memory allocation/deallocation
- Any connection pooling or caching strategies

## Real-world relevance

Many clients (mobile, IoT, load balancers without keepalive) do not maintain long-lived connections. This profile captures how well a framework handles the constant churn of short-lived connections - a common pattern in production environments.
