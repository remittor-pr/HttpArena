title: Validation
---

The following checks are executed by `validate.sh` for every framework subscribed to the `baseline-h2` test. The HTTPS port (8443) must be responding before checks begin.

## HTTP/2 protocol negotiation

Sends a request to `https://localhost:8443/baseline2?a=1&b=1` using `--http2` and checks the negotiated protocol version. The server must respond with **HTTP/2** (not HTTP/1.1 fallback).

## GET /baseline2 over HTTP/2

Sends `GET /baseline2?a=13&b=42` over HTTPS with HTTP/2 and verifies the response body is `55`.

## Anti-cheat: randomized query parameters

Generates random values for `a` and `b` (100-999), sends `GET /baseline2?a={a}&b={b}` over HTTP/2, and verifies the response matches the expected sum. This detects hardcoded responses.
